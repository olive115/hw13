Project Name: 
Happy or Sad

Summary:
In this project I will have a face that changes between a smile and a frown depending on the light it recieves. This will be done using a servo and a photoresistor. The computer componants are put into a box and there is a flap cut for the user to open and close. When open, the face smiles. When closed, the face frowns(because there is rain on the flap). 

Componant Parts:
Servo, photoresistor, 10 ohm resistor, male to male wires, breadboard, arduino

Timeline:
Week 1: Write proposal, begin coding servo and photoresistor code.
Week 2: Rewrite code, fix bugs in code, built arduino componant 
Week 3: Build outside box/smily face componant 
Week 4: Present 

Challenges:
I had lots of trouble getting the code right. I had to rewrite it several times and I realized I was often writing too much/writing things that were unnesacary. The arduino was became short circuited and it took me a while to firgure out
